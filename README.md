## Scraper Setup - Mac

1. Download the project and place it on your Desktop
2. Open terminal and run `cd ~/Desktop/scraper`
3. Install required components by running `yarn install`

- If this command fails, you likely need to install BOTH `npm` and `yarn`
- If you do not have `npm` installed, following the instructions
  at `https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm`
- If you do not have `yarn` installed, follow the instructions
  at `https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable `

4. Run `npm start` to execute the scrapper script
